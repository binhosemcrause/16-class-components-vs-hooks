## Description
You can find both examples of implementation in this project. 

React Class Components:
Class components are ES6 classes that extend React.Component. They manage state and lifecycle methods, allowing for dynamic and interactive UIs but require more boilerplate and involve this binding.

React Hooks:
Hooks are functions that enable state and lifecycle management in functional components, promoting simpler, cleaner, and more reusable code without the need for classes, enhancing code readability and maintainability.


## Setup

1. Clone the repository and install the dependencies
